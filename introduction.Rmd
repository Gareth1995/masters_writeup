# Introduction

## Problem Description

Wetlands are the most threatened and least protected ecosystems globally and in South Africa [@skownoNationalBiodiversityAssessment2019]. Wetlands are areas where the land is covered with water such as marshes, sedges, river deltas, edges of lakes or oceans, etc. Wetlands benefit society in many ways. These include flood control, storm buffering and water quality improvement [@clarksonWetlandEcosystemServices2013]. Wetlands are invaluable to society and their surrounding communities.

The threat to wetlands has only recently been realised locally. Wetland conservation programs for South Africa have been created as late as 2002 despite the severe wetland degradation experienced since the 1970s (Working for Wetlands 2019). As a result of the relative late response, 35-60% of South Africa's wetlands have been severely damaged or destroyed due to bad agricultural practices (Working for Wetlands 2019). As a result, there have been recent programs for wetland rehabilitation. Most notably, the Working for Wetlands, initiated in 2002. Working for Wetlands was initiated by the Water Research Commission, in partnership with the Department of Environmental Affairs, and aims to rehabilitate and protect wetlands in South Africa.

Destruction or degradation of an ecosystem leads to a decrease in species populations and/or a decrease in biodiversity. According to the WWF’s 2018 living planet report, it is stated that there has been a 60% decrease in global population biodiversity of mammals, fish, birds, reptiles and amphibians [@grootenLivingPlanetReport2018]. These views are supported by the Living Planet Index (LPI) [@mcraeDiversityWeightedLivingPlanet2017; @lohLivingPlanetIndex2005]. As a result, there has been a notable increase in effort to preserve and recover global biodiversity. The most notable being The Aichi Biodiversity targets. The Aichi Convention on Biological Diversity presented a strategic plan in 2011 to improve global biodiversity (Convention on Biological Diversity 2020). This plan is made up of 5 goals and 20 targets. The strategic plan needed appropriate metrics to measure its success, and as a result the Living Planet Index (LPI) was created. The LPI measures the progress of Aichi strategic goal C. Aichi strategic goal C states: “To improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and genetic diversity” (Convention on Biological Diversity 2020).

Biodiversity is invaluable to our ecosystems and society at large. With loss of biodiversity comes reduced ecosystem resilience [@ritchieBiodiversity2021]. It has thus been imperative to keep track of an ecosystem’s biodiversity and species population dynamics to understand the state of an ecosystem. One of the best tools to track biodiversity and species population dynamics are birds [@amatWaterbirdsBioindicatorsEnvironmental2010; @mekonenBirdsBiodiversityEnvironmental2017]. Consequently, a citizen scientist initiative, called the Coordinated Waterbird Counts (CWAC), was initiated in 1992 by the Animal Demographic Unit (ADU), to keep track of bird counts in wetlands around South Africa. The CWAC dataset has bird counts of over 200 different bird species from approximately 400 different wetland locations in South Africa. Some of these counts go back as far as the 1970s.

Wetlands and waterbirds are the subject of many conservation projects locally and worldwide. Organisations involved include Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA), Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (RAMSAR) and the Working for Wetlands initiative. Regarding the waterbirds in South Africa, there is currently a robust citizen-science based bird monitoring programme in the form of the CWAC dataset. Unfortunately, this dataset is not very accessible to the broader community. The aim of this project is to use the CWAC dataset and produce concise and effective data products, using various statistical techniques, that can be used by experts and non-experts to understand the state of the wetland and waterbird species of South Africa. 

## Background to Research

My project forms part of a larger project, The South Africa BiodIveRsity Data pIpelinE for wetlands and waterbirds (BIRDIE) https://www.sanbi.org/biodiversity/building-knowledge/biodiversity-monitoring-assessment/freshwater-programme-birdie-project. BIRDIE is a project that aims to collate all types of wetland data, perform statistical analysis, and make the output available to the public. 

The output will be relevant at national, regional and local levels. At the national level, the data output provides insights of the state of South African wetlands and waterbirds that can be used by international conservation projects like AEWA and RAMSAR. At the regional level, the data output supports provincial conservation agencies who need to make a range of decisions about the conservation of sites and species. For example, some species are hunted and quotas need to be set. At the local level, the data output aids wetland site managers' decision making regarding the preservation of the wetland and its bird species. Furthermore, the output is also beneficial to bird watchers in helping identify which bird species are present at which wetlands. 

The BIRDIE project is being conducted by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), in association with FitzPatrick Institute for African Ornithology (FIAO, UCT), the Centre for Statistics in Ecology, Environment and Conservation (SEEC at the University of Cape Town), Seascape Belgium and the Royal Belgium Institute of Natural Sciences (RBINS).  The end goal is to provide automated statistical computing processes on various wetland data and produce effective visualisations and other data specific output hosted on a web app.

One of the key datasets in the BIRDIE project is the CWAC dataset. The CWAC dataset is well managed and maintains standard protocols for the counters to ensure reliable counts. The census data captured are also presented to international biodiversity contributors such as AEWA and the RAMSAR convention.

CWAC counts usually take place twice a year. Once in summer, traditionally during January and February, and once in winter, traditionally during July. The counting protocol is standardised to increase reliability of the counts and the ability to compare counts across different wetland sites. Counters are encouraged to adhere to these methods as closely as possible. Variables such as number of counters, routes followed, time of day, tide, viewing technique, viewing aids, personnel and counting technique are all kept constant for each wetland. Due to varying terrains and environments, each wetland may require slightly different counting techniques, but these techniques remain constant once established. Further information on the CWAC counting procedure can be found on the CWAC website (http://www.adu.org.za/docs/cwac-info4.pdf). 

The CWAC dataset is essential in identifying patterns in species abundance, biodiversity and population dynamics over time, which is an important step in identifying wetland health, and to measure if wetland rehabilitation programs have been working.

## State space time series model (SSM)

State-space models (SSMs) have become a popular tool used by ecologists to analyse ecological time series. There is enough evidence to argue that SSMs should be the default tool in analysing time series for ecologists [@auger-metheGuideStatespaceModeling2021]. SSMs have been used in various ecological studies such as fisheries stock assessment [@aeberhardRobustEstimationDiscretetime2021], movement ecology [@pattersonStateSpaceModels2008] and, most commonly, modelling population dynamics [@newmanStateSpaceModels2014]. These are only a few examples of where SSMs are used. Their application in ecology is vast.

SSMs are able to model temporal autocorrelation in a way that separates observation error from process error [@auger-metheGuideStatespaceModeling2021]. Herein lies the value of SSMs. SSMs are hierarchical models that essentially model two different time series. One being the state process (latent process or hidden process) which is the unobserved time series that represents the true underlying population dynamics. The other being the observation process that represents the observed counts of that state process. Count data is often prone to observation error, especially when counting large groups of birds. Therefore, separating the observation process from the state process provides a more accurate estimation of the true population. The beauty of this methodology is that variation attributed to population size, population growth rate, environmental stochasticity and any other forms of stochasticity can be estimated from the model [@keryBayesianPopulationAnalysis2011]. This allows the ecologist to program the state space time series model such that it accounts for known biological factors that affect the population dynamics. This includes birth rates, death rates, fecundity, immigration, emigration, etc. Figure 1 shows a simple visual illustration of this separation between state and observation processes.

  \caption{A visual representation of a state space model where $X_t$ represents the unobserved population level changes. SSMs use the observed population counts, $Y_t$, to estimate the population level changes.}
\end{figure}

When applying SSMs to count data there are two important conditions that must be met for the SSM to produce unbiased estimates of population size. Firstly, false negative (false detections) and false positive (double counting) observations should cancel out on average. Secondly, there should be no temporal patterns in detection probability or false positive rates over time [@keryBayesianPopulationAnalysis2011].

## Bioindicators

Fitting SSMs to population data helps us understand how the population of individual species have fluctuated over time, but these models don’t tell the user much about the biodiversity of the ecosystem. This is where bioindicators and indices come in. In this dissertation, bioindicators refer to biological aspects of an ecosystem that reflect changes in the ecosystem. For example, birds are good organisms to use as bioindicators as they reflect various environmental changes directly [@mekonenBirdsBiodiversityEnvironmental2017]. Indices,  in this dissertation, refer to summarised population count information. The Living Planet Index (LPI) is an example of such an index.

Environmental assessments play an important role in environmental decision-making. This has lead to a stark increase in assessment reports that are based on bioindicators [@niemeijerFramingEnvironmentalIndicators2008]. According to @niemeijerFramingEnvironmentalIndicators2008, the bioindicators used in these reports often follow a common causal chain. This means that the bioindicator in use directly reflects specific changes in an ecosystem. For example, a decrease in wetland water level would be reflected in the declining population of waterbird species of that wetland [@burgessHabitatManagementMidContinent1969]. @niemeijerFramingEnvironmentalIndicators2008 argue that the bioindicators commonly used are too specific. One should instead use bioindicators that reflect multiple changes in an ecosystem. Bird species are ideal bioindicators to use as they reflect many aspects of an ecosystem [@mekonenBirdsBiodiversityEnvironmental2017]. 

According to @gregoryUsingBirdsIndicators2003, effective bioindicators are quantitative, easy to collect, simple to interpret, reflect causes of change in an ecosystem and indicate general patterns of taxa in the ecosystem. Bird count data fits this well. As bird counts are relatively easy to collect (and readily available), quantitative, simple to interpret and their population fluctuations are sensitive to various changes in an ecosystem.

Birds have been used to indicate the eutrophication levels in wetlands in the Mar Menor lagoon of south-eastern Spain [@amatWaterbirdsBioindicatorsEnvironmental2010]. Eutrophication refers to an excess of nutrients (such as Phosphorus, Nitrogen and other plant nutrients) present in a body of water which negatively impacts drinking water and aquatic life. It was discovered that the Great Crested Grebe abundance increased as the eutrophication levels in the lagoon increased. The increase in eutrophication was a result of nutrient run-off from nearby agricultural practices. Another example from Southern Spain shows the use of Red-Knobbed Coots to indicate the siltation rate in the water and soil in wetlands [@amatWaterbirdsBioindicatorsEnvironmental2010]. The Red-Knobbed Coot experienced a stark decline in abundance in the 20th century in Southern Spain. This decrease in abundance is attributed to the increased siltation rates in the water and soil in the wetlands in Southern Spain, caused by invasive agricultural practices. The increased rates of siltation negatively affected the quality of food for the Coots in their wetlands, and thus lead to their demise. Thus, the Red-Knobbed Coots population over time could be indicative of siltation rates in the wetlands in which they are based. These are only two examples of how effective waterbirds are as bioindicators. Other examples show how waterbirds can be indicators for changes in water level in a wetland [@burgessHabitatManagementMidContinent1969] and species abundance at lower trophic levels [@mekonenBirdsBiodiversityEnvironmental2017].

An important aspect of ecosystem health is biodiversity. Rich biodiversity is indicative of a healthy ecosystem. Each species has their part to play in the ecosystem with varying degrees of importance. Tracking biodiversity in an ecosystem can also indicate the presence of invasive species [@hooperEffectsBiodiversityEcosystem2005]. Biodiversity indicators are therefore essential in tracking the overall health of a wetland ecosystem.

Biodiversity can be defined by two basic components. That is, how many different species are present in an ecosystem [@magurranMeasuringBiologicalDiversity2003] and how many individuals per species are present in an ecosystem (evenness) [@bucklandMonitoringChangeBiodiversity2005]. Based on these components of biodiversity, a community with more species tends to have higher biodiversity than a community with fewer species and a community that displays high levels of evenness is regarded more diverse than a community with the same number of species but that displays high levels of unevenness. Regarding the concept of evenness, if two communities have the same number of species,  the one where each species is equally abundant (high degree of evenness) is more diverse than one where there are a few common species and the rest are rare (high degree of unevenness).

Two of the more common biodiversity indices are the Shannon's entropy and the Simpson's index. The exponentiated Shannon’s entropy reflects the effective number of species in an ecosystem based on the species counts [@jostEntropyDiversity2006]. The Simpson’s index presents a measure of evenness in a community with one being perfect evenness and zero being very poor evenness. Evenness refers to how similar the species are in their relative frequencies. If a community has equal counts for each species the Simpson’s index would be one and the community of waterbird species would be perfectly even. If there are one or two species that have significantly higher counts than the rest, then the Simpson’s index would be closer to zero indicating that the community is uneven, and some species are dominant in the ecosystem.

There are currently various indices used, worldwide, that aggregate and measure species trends. These are used to provide an overview of the species health in an ecosystem. The main index in use, globally, is the Living Planet Index (LPI) [@collenMonitoringChangeVertebrate2009]. There are other similar indices such as the Australian Threatened Species Index (TSX) [@bayraktarovThreatenedSpeciesIndex2020] and the Wild Bird Index (WBI) [@gregoryWildBirdIndicators2010]. Both the TSX and the WBI are based on the calculations used by the LPI. The LPI and the indices based on the LPI, aggregates species population trends to form an overall population trend. This differs from biodiversity indices in that the focus is on population trend instead of individual aspects of biodiversity. As a result the LPI and like indices are better referred to as abundance indices.

The LPI aggregates population trends across species in different systems (Terrestrial, Freshwater, Marine) and realms (Palearctic, Afrotropical, etc) to form a global index. This index is essentially calculating the aggregated population change from a reference year (1970) to every year after that. The index value is initiated to one in year 1970. For example, if the index is 1 in 1970 and 1.2 in 1990 then this would reflect a 20% increase from 1970 to 1990. 

Choosing the best index to use is a difficult task as decision science has rarely been applied to these global indices to evaluate their effectiveness and their design [@watermeyerUsingDecisionScience2021]. However, a study by @watermeyerUsingDecisionScience2021 was conducted that applied decision science techniques to 9 different, commonly used, global environmental indices, one being the LPI. Based on the study, the LPI performed well in 4 of the 5 criteria used. The criteria being: How well the index meets its objectives, design, behaviour, methods to test uncertainty, and feasibility. The LPI performed well in all aspects except for feasibility. 

The LPI was initiated in 1997 by the WWF and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre. It is the most used index that monitors average vertebrate trends around the world. These trend estimates are based on data from as far back as 1970. It uses time-series data from around the world and aims to measure the state of the world’s population trends of vertebrate species. The Index covers the terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. The time series data are further broken up into its specific biomes and geographic realms or oceans.


## Aim and Objectives

The aim of this study is to extract relevant information from the CWAC dataset such as trends and biodiversity indices to track bird species population dynamics and biodiversity. State-space time series models (SSMs) are used to model the population dynamics. SSMs are also good for forecasting future values or estimating missing values which is suitable for the CWAC dataset as it contains missing counts for some years. In this dissertation missing values are treated as unknown values that the SSM predicts.

When applying SSMs in a Bayesian framework, we are able to produce credible intervals for each of the unknown parameters by making use of the posterior distribution. The posterior distribution is the range of predicted values output by the SSM for each unknown parameter. The SSM is key to the following aims as the posterior sample (obtained from the posterior distribution) is used for further calculations to develop bioindicators.  

When formulating biodiversity indices from data, it is important to first understand what needs to be monitored [@yoccozMonitoringBiologicalDiversity2001]. Given the context of wetland and waterbird conservation, multiple types of indices and indicators were necessary to produce a holistic view of the state of the wetland and waterbirds present. The metrics used, in this dissertation, to measure biodiversity were the exponentiated Shannon’s entropy and the Simpson’s index (as biodiversity indices) and a modified Living Planet Index (LPI) (as a population trend index).

Wetland and waterbird conservationists will be able to utilise these indices and output from the time series models to understand the state of the wetland in terms of its bird species. Furthermore, it can be used as a tool by AEWA, Ramsar and bird watchers, to monitor the waterbird species in South Africa. The Barberspan wetland is used as pilot study, but if successful, this analysis can be used on all wetland sites represented in the CWAC dataset.

The following are the objectives that, if followed, will lead to successful completion of the aim:

1.    Research and develop relevant state-space time series models for bird population dynamics in Barberspan. These models can be used for understanding the change of bird counts over time and forecasting future values.
2.    Identify species attributes that may affect the population dynamics.
3.    Formulate relevant biodiversity and abundance indices using the output of the state-space model.
4.    Formulate both the state-space model and biodiversity indices such that they display a good overview of wetland state that can be used by both non-experts and experts.
